                    JavaScript is a programming language used on websites. Using JavaScript allows the web page to update the page, change the page, and react
                to feedback from the user. These are things that cannot be done with just HTML or CSS, and thus makes JavaScript very useful when creating
                a website. Java can also calculate, manipulate, and validate data, which means it can handle input from the user and then react to the input.
                Lastly, since javascript can manipulate the page with out having to refresh the browser, it can be used when animating a web page with interesting
                movements and changes.

                    PHP(Stands For PHP: Hypertext Processor) is a scripting language that is well suited for web development, and be embedded into HTML. 
                PHP code is executed server-side, and send the resulting HTML to the client on the other end. This not only makes it easier on the client's
                computer but also hides the code away from the client, makign it so they never know how you did something or what you can do. PHP is also integrated
                with many databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQl, and more. It's ability to run server-side and manipulate data makes it very useful in today's web climate.

                    Unlike the other listed on this page, AJAX(Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) is not a programming language. AJAX is a technique for accessing
                a web server from a web page. Being Asynchronous, it does not need to refresh the page in order to change it's content. Most current web 
                pages would have to refresh in order to contact the server. Using AJAX, it would not have to. For example, when filling out a form online, you would
                have to press submit, and then the page refreshs, having sent the data to the server and putting you on a different page.
                With AJAX, it could contact the server with the information without having to refresh, just updating soem part of the screen or redirecting you 
                to a different page. Lastly, AJAX can use many formats to communicate with the server, including JSON, HTML, XML, and text files.
